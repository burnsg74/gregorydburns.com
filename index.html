Summary
I have a long and successful programming career starting in high school with my first computer that came with MS BASIC. I could not afford 
college so I joined the Military, and it turned out to be a great decision. I was able to score high on the entry test and got a highly tec
hnical job, I was able to learn discipline and conduct, go to college getting my Bachelor Of Science In Information Technology, and buildin
g different application I used at work for things like log tracking. When I got out of the Military I combined my skill I learn from the Mi
litary and my love of programming in my first job at Interpacket. I continue to build applications and scripts to fit the needs of my job. 
That company was bought out so a group of us started a new company AsiaTel. It was with this company I learned about web programming, first
 with perl and then switching to PHP. Because it was a small startup I quickly learn all it took to run all things technical for the compan
y. Unfortunately the CEO did not want to sick thru it and the startup ended. I spent the next 5 years doing freelancing and starting my own
 Company VoIPTools but I found out there was just not effort need for my product so I starting working for a client of the company as the V
P of IT at Red Pocket Mobile. I continue to keep up to speed on Web Development, as while as all supporting technology. The company is now 
starting to downsize which leads me to you. I'm ready to put my years of training and experience to work for you.

I'm a senior professional, and take pride if producing code that looks and works like it; even if I'm the only one that will see the code.
